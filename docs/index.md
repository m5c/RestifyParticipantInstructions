# Welcome!

Welcome to the the *RESTify Experiment*.

 * By participating in this study you actively support research, just for that I already would like to thank you!
 * You will be completely anonymous to anyone outside the study. For any ethical concerns or questions, please contact [McGill's *Research Ethics Board*](mailto:lynda.mcneil@mcgill.ca). The study reference is:  
```REB-21-03-009```
 * Two exciting and straightforward engineering tasks await you. However, be aware that:  
You have to **exactly** follow the individual task instructions.  
You must document your activity. 
 * For any technical concern, please contact the [principal investigator](mailto:maximilian.schiedermeier@mcgill.ca).

## Before you begin

Time itself is a primary metric in this study. Before you tackle the two main tasks, please [run through all preliminary tasks](preliminaries). This will ensure that:

 * All required software is ready to use on your system.
 * You obtained the skills required for task completion.

 > **Belated installation of required software renders your data worthless to the experiment!!**

## Your main tasks

Your task is to convert two legacy java programs into RESTful services. Everything you need for these tasks [is provided](preliminaries).

However, it is **absolutely inevitable** that you solve these tasks:

 * In the requested order - you must begin by RESTifying the right application (bookstore/xox)
 * With the requested tool - you must begin with the requested approach (manual/tool-assisted)

 > **If you change task order, context or approach, your data is worthless to the experiment!**

This table tells you which task to begin with, which tool to use and which application to RESTify:


| Group | Red | Green | Yellow | Blue |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Task A | BookStore, TouchCORE | BookStore, Manually | Xox, TouchCORE | Xox, Manually |
| Task B | Xox, Manually | Xox, TouchCORE | BookStore, Manually | BookStore, TouchCORE |

 > **Example**: Alice is in the *Green* group. She begins by converting Xox into a RESTful application using TouchCORE. Afterwards she manually converts the BookStore into a RESTful application, using her preferred IDE.

## After completion

Once completed you must provide all collected data to the PI. Follow the [upload instructions](upload), the PI then emails you an Amazon gift card.
