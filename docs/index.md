# Welcome!

Welcome to the the *RESTify Experiment*.

 * By participating in this study you actively support research, just for that I already would like to thank you!
 * You will be completely anonymous to anyone outside the study. For any ethical concerns or questions, please contact [McGill's *Research Ethics Board*](mailto:lynda.mcneil@mcgill.ca). The study reference is:  
```REB-21-03-009```
 * Two exciting and straightforward engineering tasks await you. However, be aware that:  
You have to **exactly** follow the individual task instructions.  
You must document your activity. 
 * For any technical concern, please contact the [principal investigator](mailto:maximilian.schiedermeier@mcgill.ca).

 > This documentation is linear. Follow the instructions as you read them. Do not alternate the order or skip sections. The experiment is finished once you have reached the end of this documentation.

## Before you begin

Time itself is a primary metric in this study. Before you tackle the two main tasks, please now [run through all preliminary tasks](preliminaries). This will ensure that:

 * All required software is ready to use on your system.
 * You obtained the skills required for task completion.

 > **Belated installation of required software renders your data worthless to the experiment! Do not continue before you finished the [preliminaries](preliminaries).**

## Your main tasks

Your task is to convert two legacy java programs into RESTful services.  
However, it is **absolutely inevitable** that you solve these tasks:

 * In the requested order - you must begin by RESTifying the right application (BookStore/TicTacToe)
 * With the requested tool - you must begin with the requested tool (Manual/TouchCORE)

 > **If you change task order, context or approach, your data is worthless to the experiment!**

This table tells you which task to begin with, which tool to use and which application to RESTify:


| Group / Task | Red | Green | Yellow | Blue |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| First | App: BookStore, Tool: TouchCORE | App: BookStore, Tool: Manual | App: TicTacToe, Tool: TouchCORE | App: TicTacToe, Tool: Manual |
| Second | App: TicTacToe, Tool: Manual | App: TicTacToe, Tool: TouchCORE | App: BookStore, Tool: Manually | App: BookStore, Tool: TouchCORE |

 > **Example**: Alice is in the *Green* group. She begins by converting Xox into a RESTful application using TouchCORE. Afterwards she manually converts the BookStore into a RESTful application, using her preferred IDE.

Please now [proceed to the task material page](tasks), download the App context and begin your first task, according your column and group colour. Once finished, download the second App context and follow your second task with the complementary tool.

 > **Don't forget to start your screen recording!**

## After completion

Once completed you must provide all collected data to the PI. Follow the [upload instructions](upload), the PI then emails you an Amazon gift card.
