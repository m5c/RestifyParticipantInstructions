# Welcome!

Welcome to the the *RESTify Experiment*.

 * By participating in this study you actively support research, just for that I already would like to thank you!
 * You will be completely anonymous to anyone outside the study. For any ethical concerns or questions, please contact [McGill's *Research Ethics Board*](mailto:lynda.mcneil@mcgill.ca). The study reference is:  
```REB-21-03-009```
 * Two exciting and straightforward engineering tasks await you. However, be aware that...
     * ... you must **exactly** follow the individual task instructions.  
     * ... you must document your activity. 
 * For any technical concern, please contact the [principal investigator](mailto:maximilian.schiedermeier@mcgill.ca).


These instructions are linear. Follow the instructions as you read them. Do not alternate the order or skip sections. Also, do not return to your first task, once you have started your second task. The experiment is finished, once you have reached the end of this documentation.

 > tl;dr: read everything, read it carefully! We will verify your upload before compensation.

## Before you begin

Time itself is a primary metric in this study. Before you start with the two main tasks, please **first** [run through all preliminary tasks](preliminaries). This will ensure that:

 * All required software is ready to use on your system.
 * You obtained the skills required for task completion.

 > **Belated installation of required software renders your data worthless to the experiment! Do not continue before you finished the [preliminaries](preliminaries).**

## Your main tasks

**Upon completion** of [the preliminary tasks](preliminaries), please proceed to the two main tasks.

 * It is **absolutely crucial** that you respect task order and details.
    * Process the tasks in the requested order.
    * Double check the codebase:  
Your second task will require you to work on a different application than the first.
    * Make sure to use the right approach:  
Your second task will require you to apply a different methodology than the first.
 *  Record your on screen activity:
Run a screen recording from the moment you first open the task description until completion.
    * It is allowed to take breaks and submit multiple screen recordings per task. However, in that case your recordings must in their entirety still cover all your task activity. Furthermore, the submitted file must be named in a way that clearly indicates their chronological order.

 > **If you change task order, context or approach, or do not document your activity, your data will be worthless to the experiment!**

## After completion

Once completed you must provide all collected data to the PI. Follow the [upload instructions](upload), the PI then emails you an Amazon gift card.
