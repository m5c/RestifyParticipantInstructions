# Welcome!

Welcome to the the *RESTify Experiment*.

 * By participating in this study you play an active and important part in cutting edge research and I already thank you for your time and dedication.
 * The tasks awaiting you in this experiment are straightforward, but it is essential that you accuratley follow the instructions as closely as possible. I recommend you leave this page open as orientation you proceed.

## Before you begin

 Please start with the [*Preliminary Tasks*](...). Here we verify that you have all software installed and ready to use that is required for the actual experiment tasks.  
Since time to task completion is itself a metric, it is important that you have all required tools at hands before you continue.  
In this section I will also provide you the programmatic skills required for task completion.

## Your main tasks

Two principal engineering tasks await you in this experiment. It is **absolutely inevitable** that you solve these tasks:

 * In the requested order
 * With the requested tool

Order and tool vary from participant to participant. Please consult below table to determine which task to start with and which tool to apply per task.


| | Red | Green | Yellow | Blue |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Task A | BookStore, TouchCORE | ... | ... | ... |
| Task B | ... | ... | ... | ... |


## After completion

Finally you have to submit your work to a provided server space. Detailed instructions and a checklist are here. Once your material is confirmed you will receive your gift card per email.
