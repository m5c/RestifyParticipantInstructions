Your task will be to formalize the provided interface description, and establish a semantic mapping on existing functionality and parameters.

 > It's a good practice to have the textual description open throughout your task. For your convenience the [Zoo description also is available as separate file](interface-zoo.txt) (as will be the case for the descriptions you'll work with throughout your tasks).

There are two ways to achieve this. In each task...

 * ... I'll first walk you through the required steps (using the Zoo).
 * ... then I'll ask you to convert a different application the same way.

## Heads up!

If anything in this preliminary section did not work as expected, **do not continue**!

 * Do not proceed to the tasks! Instead send an email to the [principal investigator](mailto:maximilian.schiedermeier@mcgill.ca).
 * We will arrange a direct zoom call to debug your setup.
 * If everything fails we will provide you with a prepared machine.

If everything worked as expected you may now proceed to your first task.
