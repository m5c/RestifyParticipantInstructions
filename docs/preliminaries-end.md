Your task will be to formalize the provided interface description, and establish a semantic mapping on existing functionality and parameters.

 > It's a good practice to have the textual description open throughout your task. For your convenience the [Zoo description as is avaible as separate file](interface-zoo.txt) (as will be the case for the decriptions you'll work with throughout your tasks).

There are two ways to achieve this. In each task...

 * ... I'll first walk you through the required steps (using the Zoo).
 * ... then I'll ask you to convert a different application the same way.

You are now ready for [your first task](../task1)!
