 > Your task will be to formalize the provided interface description, and establish a semantic mapping on existing functionality and parameters.

There are two ways to achieve this. In each task I'll first walk you through the required steps on the example of the Zoo. Then I'll ask you to convert another application the same way, based on a provided REST interface description.

You are now ready for [your first task](../task1)!
