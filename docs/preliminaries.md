## Screencast

You **must** document your task solving with a start-to-end screencast. This can be done offline with the software *Zoom*.

Please now test a 10 second screen recording and verify the video is stored to your computer. Also make sure that no personal folders or files are visible on your desktop.

 > **Your submission is not considered complete unless you include the screencast! Place a big fat sticker on your desk so you do not forget to turn on recoding before you start working on the main tasks!**

After your test screencast, [continue to the main tasks](../#your-main-tasks).
