# Task Material

This page brings all the material you need for your refactoring tasks.

 * Code and documentation of the legacy applications you must restify.
 * Interface description of your expected task outcome. Your code will be testes agains these interfaces.

 > **Make sure to realize the two engineering tasks in the correct order and using the correct tools. This does not necessarily correspond to the order of appearance on this page!**

## Applications

 * Begin with the application [corresponding your first task](../#your-main-tasks).
 * Only look at the remaining application once you finished your first task.

## REST Interface Descriptions
